# Decision and evidence log

## 2026-11-01 — CA2 V3 restart
- New GitHub repository: `steph02333/HBM-4E-V3`.
- Local Windows results root: `C:\CA2 result V2` (not directly accessible by connector).
- Previous datasets, previous mesh outputs, previous optimizer predictions and ML training are retired as experimental evidence. No old datapoints will be carried into V3.
- Stage-gated workflow adopted. Prof Lim's first requirement (single-TSV analytical benchmark) is current task.
- Q3D termed **reference EM solver** rather than ground truth.
- Physical model changes trigger revalidation of impacted numerical results.
- This log documents decisions, not a record of an Ansys solver execution.
- Next action: implement and run the fresh G01 benchmark on the user's Ansys machine; return raw outputs, then evaluate against the gate.

## Evidence ledger
| Gate | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| G01 | Prof Lim email + CA1 Wang 2014 formula + benchmark design | SPECIFIED, NOT RUN |
| G02–G07 | Not yet generated | NOT STARTED |
